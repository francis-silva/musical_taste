Like the way you slip. There ain't nothing like a two's up. That's the way it is, two's up. It's what I want to hear. Give me head, give me tails. Give me doubled up and coming over on the rails. Two's up, it's locomotion. Two's up, you're drivin' me wild. Give me high, give me low. Give me twice the satisfaction. Twice the pot of gold (?). And it's a two's up. It's gonna be two's up.

Stray dogs. Gonna take them in. I don't know what your names are. But you're gonna break them in. All day. It's difficult to say. Who is doing what to whom. Who's out of the play. I love.

The earth was quaking. My mind was aching. And we were makin' it. and you.... Shook me all night long. Yeah you, shook me all night long. Walking double time on the seduction line. She was one of a kind. She's just mine all mine. Wanted no applause. It's just another cause. Made a meal out of me, and come back for more. Had to cool me down. To take another round. Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing. But the walls was shaking. Earth was quaking. My mind was aching. And we were making it. and you.... Shook me all night long. Yeah you, shook me all night long. Knockin' me out, yeah you. Shook me all night long. You really shook me, yeah you. Shook me all night long. Yeah, you shook me. Well you shook me....
